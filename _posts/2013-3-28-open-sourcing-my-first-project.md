  <h2>Not for long</h2>
  <hr />	  
  <p>For the past few weeks, I have been working feverishly on a new coding project. Unlike my other projects, however, this project is one I plan to turn into a tool used by the developer community; not just another fun app.</p>
  <p>Instead of just hacking something together, I have dedicated more of my time to establishing a good foundation for this project. Initially, the minimal viable product took a weekend to put together. Over the past few months, however, I have been iterating on the design and testing it on my friends at MoPub. Over this time, it has converged to a tool that now plays a significant role here at MoPub.</p>

<h2>The Project</h2>
<hr />
<p>It's complete! It's tested! It even has documentation and a tutorial video! I will also be presenting the tool at a meetup to developers who have heard and are anxious about the project. It will be officially open-sourced this coming Monday.</p>
<p>This is an exciting endeavor for me. I code all the time, but I have never emersed myself in a community project; I hope this new project will fulfill that void and become something bigger than any of my previous projects.</p>
<hr />
<p>I will plan a separate post for the release of this project. Stay tuned.</p>
