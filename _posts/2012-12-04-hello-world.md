<p class="large-letter">Guess what? I'm blogging again. Yep; third time's the charm.</p>

<p>You probably found this post from some random FB posting, tweet, or carrier pigeon and you're probably asking yourself...</p> 
<p><i>why am I reading this and why should I continue?</i></p>
<hr/>
<h2>Here's my pitch: </h2>
<hr />
<p>This blog will be full of random hacking projects. </p>
<h3>FULL OF THEM </h3> 
<p>...yep. I've decided that I'm going to devote more time to building long-term projects. I'm done with websites and apps for now; it's fun, but it's just not interesting anymore.</p> 
<p>Most of the projects I will be working on will be geared on making <b>DevOps</b> as simple as possible. Configuration and Monitoring on a massive scale. Backend system design and optimizations. Recovery tools. At <a href="http://mopub.com">MoPub</a>, we handle billions of requests everyday, so I have a perfect opportunity to explore.</p>
